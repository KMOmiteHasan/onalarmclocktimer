                  <h4>Last Updated: May 2016</h4>
                  <p>
                    This site is owned and operated by Comfort Software Group
                    (hereinafter referred to as "CSG"). Your privacy on the
                    Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At CSG, we want
                    to make your experience online satisfying and safe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because we gather certain types of information about our
                    users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and
                    conditions surrounding the capture and use of that
                    information. This privacy statement discloses what
                    information we gather and how we use it.
                  </p>
                  <p><b>INFORMATION CSG GATHERS AND TRACKS</b></p>
                  <p>CSG gathers two types of information about users:</p>
                  <p>
                    Information that users provide through optional, voluntary
                    submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our
                    electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards
                    or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in
                    polls and surveys:
                  </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Information CSG gathers through aggregated tracking
                    information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout
                    our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our
                    content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and
                    sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience.
                    Because CSG derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and
                    advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is
                    essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no
                    circumstances does CSG divulge any information about an
                    individual user to a third party.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    CSG Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:
                  </p>
                  <p>Optional Voluntary Information</p>
                  <p>
                    We offer the following free services, which require some
                    type of voluntary submission of personal information by
                    users:
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)</p>
                  <p>
                    We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. CSG
                    gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily
                    subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing
                    list by following the link provided in every newsletter that
                    points users to the subscription management page. Users can
                    also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of
                    registration.
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Message boards/forums</p>
                  <p>
                    Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register
                    separately for these services (both are free of charge) in
                    order to post messages, although they needn't register to
                    visit the site. During registration the user is required to
                    supply a username, password, and email address.
                  </p>
                  <p>3. "E-mail this to a friend" Service</p>
                  <p>
                    Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link,
                    page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this
                    to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as
                    well as that of the recipient. This information is used only
                    in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let
                    the recipient know who sent the email. The information is
                    not used for any other purpose.
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Polling</p>
                  <p>
                    We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily
                    share their opinions with other users and see what our
                    audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other
                    responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable
                    to any particular user. CSG may use a system to "tag" users
                    after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a
                    particular question. This tag is not correlated with
                    information about individual users.
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Surveys</p>
                  <p>
                    CSG may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target
                    our content to our audience. We sometimes share the
                    aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our
                    sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of
                    this information about specific individuals with any third
                    party.
                  </p>
                  <p>Children</p>
                  <p>
                    Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy
                    Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly
                    request personally identifiable information from anyone
                    under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.
                  </p>
                  <p>Usage tracking</p>
                  <p>
                    CSG tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our
                    sites. However, we do not correlate this information with
                    data about individual users. CSG does break down overall
                    usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser
                    type, and MIME type by reading this information from the
                    browser string (information contained in every user's
                    browser).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    CSG sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that
                    users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is
                    never associated with individual users. We use tracking
                    information to determine which areas of our sites users like
                    and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not
                    track what individual users read, but rather how well each
                    page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a
                    better service for you.
                  </p>
                  <p>Cookies</p>
                  <p>
                    We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser
                    files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain
                    Personal Information although it will enable us to relate
                    your use of this site to information that you have
                    specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal
                    information a cookie can contain is information you supply
                    yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or
                    read cookie files created by other sites. CSG uses cookies
                    to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our

                  <p><b>USE OF INFORMATION</b></p>
                  <p>
                    CSG uses any information voluntarily given by our users to
                    enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to
                    provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or
                    to better prepare future content based on the interests of
                    our users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily
                    provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to
                    enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message
                    boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers
                    on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and
                    occasionally send out special editions when we think
                    subscribers might be particularly interested in something we
                    are doing. CSG never shares newsletter mailing lists with
                    any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or
                    partners.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When we use tracking information to determine which areas of
                    our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to
                    those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but
                    rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us
                    continue to build a better service for you. We track search
                    terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of
                    what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a
                    particular user enters.
                  </p>
                  <p><b>SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</b></p>
                  <p>
                    CSG uses the above-described information to tailor our
                    content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better
                    understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to
                    keeping our service free. We will not share information
                    about individual users with any third party, except to
                    comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to
                    protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
                  </p>
                  <p><b>SECURITY</b></p>
                  <p>
                    CSG operates secure data networks protected by industry
                    standard firewall and password protection systems. Our
                    security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and
                    enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have
                    access to the information provided by our customers.
                  </p>
                  <p><b>OPT-OUT POLICY</b></p>
                  <p>
                    We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such
                    choices include:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Opting not to register to receive our electronic
                    newsletters.

                  <p></p>
                  <p>
                    Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas,
                    which completely alleviates the need to gather any
                    personally identifiable information from our users
                  </p>
                  <p><b>YOUR CONSENT</b></p>
